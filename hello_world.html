    Woo, I am trying a new tool
    <div class="dream on">
    <ul>
      here is the lyrics of "dream on" in unordered list below:
      <li>every time that i look in the mirror</li>
      <li>all these lines in my face getting clearer</li>
      <li>the past is gone</li>
      <li>It went by like dusk to dawn </li>
      <li>Isn't that the way </li>
      <li>Everybody's got their dues in life to pay </li>
      <li>Well, I know, nobody knows </li>
      <li>Where it comes and where it goes </li>
      <li>I know it's everybody's sin </li>
      <li>You got lose to know how to win </li>
      <li>Half my life's in books' written pages</li>
      <li>Lived and learned from fools and from sages</li>
      <li>You know it's true, oh</li>
      <li>All these things come back to you</li>
      <li>sing with me, sing for the years</li>
      <li>sing for the laugh and sing for the tear</li>
      <li>Sing with me, just for today</li>
      <li>Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take it away</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <section class="hightlight">

            <li>I hide this just for fun</li>
            <li>I am a lazy guy, but not this time</li>
          </ul>
          <li>this is the second line</li>
          <li>this is the third line</li>
