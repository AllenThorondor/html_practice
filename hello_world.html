    Woo, I am trying a new tool
    <div class="dream on">
    <ul>
      here is the lyrics of "dream on" in unordered list below:
      <li>every time that i look in the mirror</li>
      <li>all these lines in my face getting clearer</li>
      <li>the past is gone</li>
      <li>It went by like dusk to dawn </li>
      <li>Isn't that the way </li>
      <li>Everybody's got their dues in life to pay </li>
      <li>Well, I know, nobody knows </li>
      <li>Where it comes and where it goes </li>
      <li>I know it's everybody's sin </li>
      <li>You got lose to know how to win </li>
      <li>Half my life's in books' written pages</li>
      <li>Lived and learned from fools and from sages</li>
      <li>You know it's true, oh</li>
      <li>All these things come back to you</li>
      <li>sing with me, sing for the years</li>
      <li>sing for the laugh and sing for the tear</li>
      <li>Sing with me, just for today</li>
      <li>Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take it away</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="style">this is my second line of html</p>

    <section>
      <p>Oh, it's just me, myself and I
          Solo ride until I die
          Cause I, got me for life
          yeah
          Oh I don't need a hand to hold
          Even when the night is cold
          I got that fire in my soul
          And as far as I can see, I just need privacy
          Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
          I just need space to do me
          Give the world what they're tryna see
          A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
          A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
          A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
          Cause this hunger is driving me, yeah
          I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
          Understand what I'm speaking on
          If time is money I need a loan
          But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
          Fuck fake friends
          We don't take L's, we just make M's
          While y'all follow, we just make trends
          I'm right back to work when that break ends
          Oh, it's just me, myself and I
          Solo ride until I die
          Cause I, got me for life
          (Got me for life, yeah)
          Oh I don't need a hand to hold
          Even when the night is cold
          I got that fire in my soul
          I don't need anything to get me through the night
          Except the beat that's in my heart
          And it's keeping me alive
          (Keeps me alive)
          I don't need anything to make me satisfied (you know)
          Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time
          Yeah, and I don't like talking to strangers
          So get the fuck off me I'm anxious
          I'm tryna be cool but I may just go ape shit
          Say "fuck y'all" to all of y'all faces
          It changes though now that I'm famous
          Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
          But I love it the rush is amazing
          Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
          I found how to cope with my anger
          I'm swimming in money
          Swimming in liquor, my liver is muddy
          But it's all good I'm still sippin' this bubbly
          This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
          Made it right here cause I'm sick with it cuddy
          They all take the money for granted
          But don't want to work for it tell me now, isn't it funny? nah
          Oh, it's just me, myself and I
          Solo ride until I die
          Cause I, got me for life
          (Got me for life, yeah)
          Oh I don't need a hand to hold
          Even when the night is cold
          I got that fire in my soul
          I don't need anything to get me through the night
          Except the beat that's in my heart
          Yeah, that's keeping me alive
          (Keeps me alive)
          I don't need anything to make me satisfied (you know)
          Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time
          Like ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
          Ba-ba-ba-da-ba (yee)
          Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
          Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
          Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
          Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
          Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time
          Yeah, lonely nights I laid awake
          Pray to lord, my soul to take
          My heart's become too cold to break
          Know I'm great but I'm broke as hell
          Having dreams that I'm folding cake
          All my life I've been told to wait
          But I'ma get it now, yeah it's no debate
          Yeah
          Oh, it's just me, myself and I
          Solo ride until I die
          Cause I, got me for life
          (Got me for life, yeah)
          Oh I don't need a hand to hold
          Even when the night is cold
          I got that fire in my soul
          I don't need anything to get me through the night
          Except the beat that's in my heart
          And it's keeping me alive
          (Keeps me alive)
          I don't need anything to make me satisfied (you know)
          Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time
          Like ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
          Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
          Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
          Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
          Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
          Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
          Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time
